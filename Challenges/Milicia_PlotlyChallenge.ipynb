    "Plotly is a really interesting framework and it definitely put a lot of ideas into my head about what I could potentially work with for my final project.  Right now my thoughts for that are leaning toward tracking impact data related to my field (well, company) across the country. With the ability to drill down into the larger data chunks using plotly's native hover and interaction (legend on/off, etc), it will be tremendously helpful and easy to better represent the story we're trying to tell. For my current role I work on the web so the ability to use dropdowns or sliders to move into and out of a data set is not only commonplace, but preferred and that mixed with the number of mapping visualizations plotly offers, could end up being a good choice for what i'm trying to accomplish, making it appealing not only for its simplicity, but for its real-world application.\n",
